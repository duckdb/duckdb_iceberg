# DuckDB extension for Apache Iceberg

This repository contains a DuckDB extension that adds support for [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/). In its current state, the extension offers some basics features that allow listing snapshots and reading specific snapshots
of an iceberg tables.

## Documentation

See the [Iceberg page in the DuckDB documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/iceberg).

## Developer guide

### Dependencies

This extension has several dependencies. Currently, the main way to install them is through vcpkg. To install vcpkg,
check out the docs [here](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html). Note that this extension contains a custom vcpkg port
that overrides the existing 'avro-cpp' port of vcpkg. The reason for this is that the other versions of avro-cpp have
some issue that seems to cause issues with the avro files produced by the spark iceberg extension.

### Test data generation

To generate test data, the script in 'scripts/test_data_generator' is used to have spark generate some test data. This is
based on pyspark 3.5, which you can install through pip.

### Building the extension

To build the extension with vcpkg, you can build this extension using:

```shell
VCPKG_TOOLCHAIN_PATH='<path_to_your_vcpkg_toolchain_cmake_file>' make
```

This will build both the separate loadable extension and a duckdb binary with the extension pre-loaded:
```shell
./build/release/duckdb
./build/release/extension/iceberg/iceberg.duckdb_extension
```

### Running tests

#### Generating test data

To generate the test data, run:
```shell
make data
```

**Note** that the script requires python3, pyspark and duckdb-python to be installed. Make sure that the correct versions for pyspark (3.5.0), java and scala (2.12) are installed.

running `python3 -m pip install duckdb pyspark[sql]==3.5.0` should do the trick.

#### Running unit tests

```shell
make test
```

#### Running the local S3 test server

Running the S3 test cases requires the minio test server to be running and populated with `scripts/upload_iceberg_to_s3_test_server.sh`.
Note that this requires to have run `make data` before and also to have the aws cli and docker compose installed.

## Acknowledgements

This extension was initially developed as part of a customer project for [RelationalAI](https://relational.ai/),
who have agreed to open source the extension. We would like to thank RelationalAI for their support
and their commitment to open source enabling us to share this extension with the community.
